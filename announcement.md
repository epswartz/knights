@everyone Here's the rundown:

**Campaign Prompt:** You are part of an order of knights who sends squads/etc around the world to deal with threats from undead, demons, etc. You have received a report that a small kingdom has had one of it's border towns overrun by skeletons. You will have time inside the knight's stronghold to prepare before leaving in any way you want except for obtaining more magic items, and then will teleport into the kingdom - you will not be able to teleport back to teh stronghold until 6 months after teleporting in, when the stars/planets/whatever are again properly aligned.

**Starting Level:** 8

**Stats:** TBD

**Classes:** All classes from PHB and archetypes from PHB and XGE are explicitly allowed. Most recent UA artificer is allowed, Matt Mercer homebrew is all allowed (most recent versions only). Mystic is not allowed.

**Races:** Most of the knights are human if you care, but it's not so strong a majority that you are seen as weird if you're not human. I'd ballpark it at around 70% human. Monstrous races are really uncommon, but not technically outlawed - talk to me

**Background:** The vows of the order dictate that they don't care what you did before, only what you do now that you're in. You all passed a zone of truth about what your intentions are when you came in, so it's fair to say you're all more or less true believers now, but feel free to have a checkered past.

**Equipment:** Any mundane equipment from the PHB that you could reasonably carry. Magic item list to be released soon.

**WARNING:** By the numbers, you guys are FAR out of your depth. The CRs are really high, and I've remedied that somewhat by letting you guys have magic items, but you are still outstatted by multiple levels. Failing to prepare and think will be a problem - try to embody the level of planning and expertise that the knights actually have.
